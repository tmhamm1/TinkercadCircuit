# TinkercadCircuit
For my Tinkercad Circuit project I decided to make a potentiometer that changes the color of a RGB LED depending on how far the knob is turned. With this I only used the red LED and the green LED and they changed colors when the potentiometer is turned. When proposing this project I was thinking of Christmas. I knew I wanted to do something with the theme of Christmas lights so I decided to go with that. I envision this could be used like lights on a Christmas tree in a real life setting. Although I particularly love the golden lights, I think color-changing lights also look nice. If I were to add to this project I would possibly use more LED lights to really incase the Christmas spirit. I've had to revise this project due to multiple mistakes but I got some help with a [reference](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/fT7Mlq8fgfq) and came up with something that I am completely satisfied with!
