For my project I decided to make a potentiometer change the brightness of a single red LED depending on the knob being turned. With this project, I see a more creative-use for it. At first I had thought of using an RGB LED, but at the last minute I changed it to a single LED because I had this idea in my head of a christmas tree. Although a bit weird, I envisioned this being used as a single LED like on a Christmas tree to add an accent color. There is probably a more functional way of doing that but for someone of my limitations I think itâ€™s a valid use. Although if built in real life I would add a color changing component.
